This project is a simple yet functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Exponentiation: `x²` and `^` for custom powers
- Square root calculation: `√`
- Clear button (`C`) to reset the calculator
- Backspace button (`⌫`) to delete the last input
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Keyboard support for input

## Usage

### Interface

1. **Display Area**:
   - **Expression Display**: Shows the current mathematical expression being input.
   - **Result Display**: Shows the result of the evaluated expression.

2. **Buttons**:
   - **C**: Clears the current expression.
   - **⌫**: Deletes the last character in the expression.
   - **()**: Adds parentheses to the expression.
   - **x²**: Squares the current number or expression.
   - **^**: Raises the current number to the power of the next number.
   - **√**: Calculates the square root of the current number or expression.
   - **÷, *, -, +**: Basic arithmetic operators.
   - **0-9, 00**: Number buttons.
   - **.**: Decimal point.
   - **=**: Evaluates the current expression and displays the result.

### Keyboard Support

- **Numbers (0-9)**: Input numbers directly.
- **Backspace**: Delete the last character in the expression.
- **Enter**: Calculate and display the result of the expression.
- **Escape**: Clear the current expression.
- **+, -, *, /**: Basic arithmetic operators.
- **.**: Decimal point.
- **Ctrl+S**: Shortcut for square root (`√`).

## Additional Features

- **Automatic Multiplication Handling**: Automatically adds a multiplication operator where it's implied, such as `5(6+3)` being treated as `5*(6+3)`.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout and button sizes for smaller screens.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
